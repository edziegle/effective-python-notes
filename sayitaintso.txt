Oh, yeah
Alright
Somebody's Heine' is crowdin' my icebox
Somebody's cold one is givin' me chills
Guess I'll just close my eyes
Oh yeah, all right, feels good inside
Flip on the tele'
Wrestle with Jimmy
Something is bubbling behind my back
The bottle is ready to blow
Say it ain't so
Your drug is a heart-breaker
Say it ain't so
My love is a life-taker
I can't confront you, I never could do
That which might hurt you so try and be cool
When I say, "This way is a water slide away from me
That takes you further every day, hey, so be cool"
Say it ain't so
Your drug is a heart-breaker
Say it ain't so
My love is a life-taker
Dear Daddy, I write you, in spite of years of silence
You've cleaned up, found Jesus, things are good or so I hear
This bottle of Steven's awakens ancient feelings
Like father, step-father, the son is drowning in the flood
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Say it ain't so
Your drug is a heart-breaker
Say it ain't so
My love is a life-taker
