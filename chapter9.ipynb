    "Assuming that demo worked as expected, 👀 coroutines were _a lot_ faster. This is because the sleep on the coroutine yielded execution back to the event loop, so the loop continued a different coroutine. The threads did something similar: they blocked, which triggered a release of the GIL, but due to the higher overhead cost of that, and the context switching involved, it was slower. Python threads **are** system threads, and therefore the OS had to save/restore CPU registers, memory mappings, etc. $$$\n",
